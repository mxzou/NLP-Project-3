# MIDI Caption Model Training

This repository contains code for training a music captioning model that generates natural language descriptions of MIDI music files using T5 with LoRA fine-tuning.

## Key Features
- Uses T5-small model with LoRA adapters for efficient fine-tuning
- Hyperparameter optimization using Weights & Biases sweeps
- Evaluation metrics including BLEU score
- Early stopping and model checkpointing
- Configurable training parameters via YAML configs
